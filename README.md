# HTTP Framework

This is a very experimental prototype of an HTTP framework for rust, very similar in scope
and in techinical decisions as nickel.rs and iron.rs.

The core reasons to do this are:
- learn more about rust
- learn more about existing rust http frameworks out there and the technical decisions they had to make in order to make them work
- learn more about http
- learn to use proficiently rust Traits
